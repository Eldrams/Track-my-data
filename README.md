# Track-my-data
Application for tracking KPI's at my sales job

<!-- Description -->

An application i made in order to fix an issue myself and collegues were having at work. Our IT department has been unable to fix the callback system at work for over a month despite numerous tickets. As well as our KPI's not being readily available to us. I made this app in order to track my own leads and KPI's as well as my team in order to improve our performance and the ease of access to information.
