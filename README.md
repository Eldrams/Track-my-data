# Track-my-data
Application for tracking KPI's at my sales job

<!-- Description -->

An application i made in order to fix an issue myself and collegues were having at work. Our IT department has been unable to fix the callback system at work for over a month despite numerous tickets. As well as our KPI's being hidden from us. I made this app in order to track my own leads and KPI's in order to improve my performance and the ease of access to information.

Tech involved:

- HTML

- CSS

- Vanilla JavaScript



GET images from unsplash RESTful API for background

Defining a single purpose of each global callback 

Creating and iterating over arrays created by user input

Tracking and updating user information

Manipulating CSS in JS

Testing each function works independently before incorporating it as a callback

Importing fonts from google and font awsome

Bug testing and fixing

Use of IDs and manipulating data based on user input
