# Track-my-data
Application for tracking KPI's at my sales job

<!-- Description -->

An application i made in order to fix an issue myself and collegues were having at work. Our IT department has been unable to fix the callback system at work for over a month despite numerous tickets. As well as our KPI's not being readily available to us. I made this app in order to track my own leads and KPI's as well as my team in order to improve our performance and the ease of access to information.

Deployed via netlify:

https://iridescent-phoenix-d6a511.netlify.app/

Tech involved:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

- noSql database (Firebase)

- GET reequests to a RESTful API

GET images from unsplash RESTful API for background

Defining a single purpose of each global callback 

Creating and iterating over arrays created by user input

Tracking and updating user information

Manipulating CSS in JS

Importing fonts from google and font awesome

Bug testing and fixing

Use of IDs and manipulating data based on user input

Writing scalabale code

Writing reusable functions and code

Proper use of asynchronous JavaScript functions and try, catch blocks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future additions:

- add a realtime database instead of local storage (based on approval from managment)  ✓

- add user authentification  ✓

- edit styling/accessibility based on user feedback  ✓

- potentially add some additional functionality based on feedback  ✓

- Allow the user to set the target (change styling to be based off %)

- Allow Background image to be changed/set by user

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

This is the first time I have created an app with user authentification, while it came with its difficulties this app
is now scalable and has the potential to harbour hundreds of users.

It is able to read and write to Firebase based on the user ID which is created at user sign up via the user authentification console in firebase.

In the future I would like to try creating my own database and utilising another language such as c#.
