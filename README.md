# Track-my-data
Application for tracking KPI's at my sales job

<!-- Description -->

An application I made to fix an issue my colleagues and I were experiencing at work. Our IT department has been unable to resolve the callback system at work for over a month, despite numerous tickets. Additionally, our KPIs are not readily available to us. I developed this app to track my own leads and KPIs, as well as those of my team, in order to enhance our performance and improve access to information.

Deployed via netlify:

https://iridescent-phoenix-d6a511.netlify.app/

Tech involved:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript

- noSQL database (Firebase)

- GET images from Unsplash RESTful API for backgrounds

Approach:

Defining a single purpose of each global callback 

Creating and iterating over arrays created by user input

Tracking and updating user information

Manipulating CSS in JavaScript

Testing each function works independently before incorporating it as a callback

Importing fonts from Google and Font Awesome

Bug testing and finding resolutions

Use of IDs to manipulate data based on user input

Employing a noSQL database to GET and POST data

Writing scalabale code and reusable code

Proper use of asynchronous JavaScript functions and try-catch blocks

Documenting the code and adding comments for readability

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future additions:

- add a realtime database instead of local storage  ✓

- Implement user authentication ✓

- Adjust styling and improve accessibility based on user feedback   ✓

- Potentially add extra functionality based on feedback  ✓

- Allow users to set targets (adjust styling based on %)

- Enable users to change/set background images

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

This marks my first experience creating an app with user authentication. Despite encountering challenges, the app is now scalable and has the potential to accommodate hundreds of users.

It is capable of reading from and writing to Firebase based on the user ID, which is created during user sign-up through the Firebase authentication console.

In the future, I aspire to create my own database and explore other languages such as C#.
